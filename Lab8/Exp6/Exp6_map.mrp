Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:            79 out of   1,920    4%

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Total REAL time to MAP completion:  1 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network XLXI_1/CEO has no load.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   8 block(s) removed
  15 block(s) optimized away
   9 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "XLXI_1/CEO" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "XLXI_1/OR_CE_L" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "XLXI_1/T2_UP" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "XLXI_1/T3_UP" is sourceless and has been removed.
The signal "XLXI_1/TC" is sourceless and has been removed.
 Sourceless block "XLXI_1/I_36_50" (AND) removed.
The signal "XLXI_1/TC_DN" is sourceless and has been removed.
 Sourceless block "XLXI_1/I_TC/I_36_7" (AND) removed.
  The signal "XLXI_1/I_TC/M0" is sourceless and has been removed.
   Sourceless block "XLXI_1/I_TC/I_36_8" (OR) removed.
The signal "XLXI_1/TC_UP" is sourceless and has been removed.
 Sourceless block "XLXI_1/I_TC/I_36_9" (AND) removed.
  The signal "XLXI_1/I_TC/M1" is sourceless and has been removed.
Unused block "XLXI_1/I_36_10" (AND) removed.
Unused block "XLXI_1/I_36_11" (AND) removed.
